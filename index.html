                    <h1>Our company<span>.</span></h1>
                    <p>Kanatel began its operations more than 50 years ago. Today it has offices in Chile, Colombia,
                        China, Pakistan and Peru; plus the United States and Vietnam with opening in 2021. We also
                        supply the markets of Uruguay, Colombia, Brazil, Central America, USA and Spain. We work on
                        different lines such as: chemicals, steels, plastics, construction, the electrical sector,
                        textiles, food, among others.

                        Our objective is to generate medium and long-term strategic alliances with our clients, in order
                        to achieve common goals. With this in mind, we have set up offices in China and trained our
                        staff based in Asia and South America. The efforts made have paid off since we have become the
                        best sales alternative for Chinese companies in Latin America.</p>
